### Content Organization

**current/** - Active work in progress:
- ADRs (architecture decisions)
- Execution plans (task breakdowns)
- Features (specifications)
- PRDs (project requirements)

**complete/** - Finished phases:
- Historical ADRs
- Completed execution plans
- Shipped feature specifications
- Archived project requirements
- Phase deliverables (skills/workflows references)

**backlog/** - Future planning:
- Exploratory ADRs
- Rough execution plans
- Feature ideas
- Future project requirements

**research/** - Research documents:
- Tool evaluations
- Capability analysis
- Technology research
- Findings that inform planning

## _temp/ - Ephemeral Working Files

Contains temporary working files with no long-term value. **NOT committed to git.**

```
_temp/
├── .gitkeep               # Ensures directory exists
├── README.md              # Explains ephemeral nature
├── PHASE2_CLEANUP_NOTES.md
├── PHASE3_RELEASE_NOTES.md
└── validation/            # Test validation reports
    ├── README.md
    ├── COVERAGE_REPORT.validation.md
    ├── MUTATION_TESTING_RESULTS.validation.md
    ├── PERFORMANCE_REPORT.validation.md
    ├── EXTRACTION_STATUS.validation.md
    ├── PHASE2_FINAL_AUDIT.validation.md
    ├── VARIANT_REWRITE_CHECKLIST.validation.md
    └── subagent-variant-audit-2026-04-10.validation.md
```

### Contents

- Validation reports (generated, reviewed, then obsolete)
- Cleanup notes (relevant during work, not after)
- Release notes (working copies)
- Temporary analysis outputs
- Build artifacts

### Guidelines

- Delete files once work completes
- Archive important findings to `planning/research/`
- Keep directory lean—it's a workspace, not an archive

## Directory Lifecycle

### Document Lifecycle

1. **Research** → Start in `planning/research/`
2. **Design** → Document in `docs/design/`
3. **Planning** → Create PRD/ADR/Features in `planning/current/`
4. **Execution** → Execution plan in `planning/current/execution-plans/`
5. **Implementation** → Build based on planning
6. **Completion** → Move to `planning/complete/`
7. **Reference** → User-facing documentation in `docs/`

### File Movement Guidelines

**When to move to planning/complete/**
- Phase/feature work is finished
- All ADRs, execution plans, and features are done
- Ready to archive current phase

**When to move to planning/backlog/**
- Feature is deprioritized
- Deferred to future work
- No longer in current scope

**When to delete from _temp/**
- Validation complete
- Report reviewed
- No longer need for reference
- Can be regenerated if needed

**When to add to docs/**
- Information is final and stable
- Useful for ongoing reference
- Intended for users or developers
- Ready to potentially publish

---

## Key Principles

**docs/** is for:
- ✓ User-facing documentation
- ✓ Reference guides
- ✓ Final design and architecture
- ✗ Work in progress
- ✗ Phase-specific artifacts

**planning/** is for:
- ✓ Development planning
- ✓ Phase-specific work
- ✓ Internal decision-making
- ✗ User-facing content

**_temp/** is for:
- ✓ Ephemeral working files
- ✓ Generated reports (temporary)
- ✓ Scratch work
- ✗ Anything that needs to persist

---

## Maintenance

- **Weekly:** Archive completed _temp/ files to planning/
- **Monthly:** Move completed planning/current/ to planning/complete/
- **As needed:** Update docs/ with stable, final documentation
